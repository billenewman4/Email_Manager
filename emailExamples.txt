Hello Derek, 

I hope you are doing well!

I am an incoming HBS student interested in pivoting to growth investing especially in the enterprise AI sector. Previously, I worked on McKinsey's PE team performing market diligences on emerging technologies like quantum computing and blockchain both to enhance enterprise operations and I am currently working in SF at a YC backed company drastically improving the yields on mushroom farming. 

Would you have 15 minutes sometime this summer to share your experiences in the growth investing space? Specifically, I would love to hear more about the tradeoffs between a pure investment firm like TPG versus your time at CapitalG and would be curious to learn more about your views on how enterprise data management is evolving. 

Best,
Bill

Hello Sam, 

I was reading your article on Lessons learned the hard way: Robotics and found the challenges you laid out very interesting, especially how hard operations can be.

As a quick introduction, I am an ex-McKinsey consultant entering my first year at HBS this fall. I am looking to make a pivot into Venture Capital after business school. 

I am also quite interested in the robotics space having tried to cultivate a perspective on the robotics industry (published here) and having identified startups like Pivot Robotics, Robust AI, and Youndu. Also, I am currently work at a start-up, Hedgehog foods, that has attempted to use robotics to decrease the cost of mushroom farming. 

If you have any availability in the coming weeks, I would love to share perspectives on the robotics industry and learn how you navigated into the VC space as it seems like you may have been in a similar position as me during our time at GSB (coming from primarily a consultanting background before). 

Best,
Bill

Hello David, 

My name is Bill Newman and I am an incoming HBS student interested in Venture Capital. I am currently working at a YC backed company Hedgehog foods and previously spent time working in development finance at the U. S. Government. 

I found your profile very interesting as your firm's emphasis on the intersection of fin-tech and impact resonates with what got me excited about development finance originally. I am hopeful to transition to VC after business school and I was curious if I could get a coffee with you this summer while I'm in SF and get your advice on how to make that transition? 

Bill
