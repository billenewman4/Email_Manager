Hello Brian, 

I hope you are having a good Friday!

I just wanted to send a quick follow up on the above email. I completely understand if you are too busy but even a 15 minute call on your commute to work would be super helpful!

Hello Johnathan, 

I just wanted to send a quick follow up note! I know you are probably very busy this summer, but if you have any time to help me learn more about Industry Ventures I would greatly appreciate it even if we need to schedule something closer to the fall.

Hi Aaron,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to follow up on my previous email about discussing the robotics industry and your experiences in VC.

If you have time in the next couple of weeks, I’d love to connect and learn from your insights.

Best,
Bill Newman
